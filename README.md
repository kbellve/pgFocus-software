pgFocus-software
================

Software that runs on the host computer connected to pgFocus

pgFocus software connects to the pgFocus hardware through a serial port.

To use this software, you will need to install Processing 2 available from processing.org

https://processing.org/download/?processing

Use Processing 2.03 rather than Processing 2.1 since the latter dropped a few functions from the serial library.

You might also need to download and install G4P ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4p/files/?source=navbar )
